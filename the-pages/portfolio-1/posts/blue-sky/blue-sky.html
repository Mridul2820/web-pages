                <p>
                    Something I never knew And a boat lies waiting Still your clouds all flaming That old time easy feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the summer of 2018, The sun was in the mid of sky. The fishing boat was stand alone at the side of river.

                    There are more life forms in a handful of forest soil than there are people on the planet.

                    Their was a drizzle and after that the sun came out in between the black clouds.

                <p>
                    A shiny sunset between the Jhau trees. The place is in the opposite side of sea beach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the last day of the world I would want to plant a tree. In a forest of a hundred thousand trees, no two leaves are alike.
